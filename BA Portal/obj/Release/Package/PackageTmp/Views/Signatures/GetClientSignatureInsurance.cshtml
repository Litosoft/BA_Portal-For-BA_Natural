<div id="border02" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Primary Care & Medical Records:</strong> Acupuncturists practicing in the state of Florida are primary care providers but BA Natural recommends that all patients receive regular yearly check-up with a licensed medical physician or Family Doctor. Furthermore, all patients must provide medical records from a primary care provider upon request.
 
    Acupuncture: Acupuncture is performed by the insertion of needles through the skin at certain points to treat bodily dysfunction(s) or disease(s), to modify or prevent pain perception, and to normalize the body’s physiological functions. There may be adverse side effects such as local bruising, minor bleeding, fainting, pain, or discomfort, lung puncture (pneumothorax), and the possible aggravation of symptoms existing prior to acupuncture treatment.
 
    Chinese Herbs: Substances from the Oriental Materia Medica may be recommended to treat bodily dysfunction(s) or disease(s) or to modify or prevent pain perception and to normalize the body physiological functions. Patients must follow the directions for administration and dosage. There may be certain adverse side effects; allergic reaction, changes in bowel movement, abdominal pain or discomfort, and the possible aggravation of symptoms existing prior to herbal treatment. With any problems associated with these substances, patients should suspend taking them and call BA Natural as soon as possible.
 
    Acupressure-Massage/Tui Na: Acupressure-massage is used to modify or prevent pain perception and to normalize the body’s physiological functions. There may be certain adverse side effects; muscle soreness or achiness and the possible aggravation of symptoms existing prior to treatment.
 
    Electro-acupuncture: Electro-acupuncture is the application of electrical current to acu-points on a patient. This can be done with either electrodes or alligator clips clamped to needles. Once the electrodes or needles are in place, a box which controls the current is turned on and the electro-acupuncture can begin. The patient is then left alone and the electrical current continues for another 20 to 30 minutes. There may be adverse side effects; electrical shock, pain or discomfort, and the possible aggravation of symptoms existing prior to treatment. IF YOU HAVE A PACEMAKER, PLEASE NOTIFY A STAFF MEMEMBER AT BA NATURAL.
 
    TDP Lamp: TDP Lamp is a medical device which comes under U.S. Food and Drug Administration Class II as a far-infrared heating device. The premise of the lamp is that the far infrared (below visible light) emissions increases microcirculation and loosens fascia to accelerate the natural healing processes of the body. The TDP lamp is used as a therapeutic substitute for moxibustion, a traditional Chinese therapy.
 
    Moxibustion: Moxibustion is a form of oriental herbal healing. It uses the mugwort herb, called moxa by the Chinese, in heated form, either on an acupuncture needle or directly on or around the skin. It is thought to stimulate blood flow, and make the person more centered.
 
    Cupping: Acupuncture cupping therapy is a form of acupuncture used to treat abdominal problems, respiratory illness and pain. In the acupuncture cupping process, plastic or glass cups are placed on the body (usually on the back) and then the air pressure inside the plastic or glass is changed, causing the skin and tissue inside the cups to be pulled up into the vacuum created inside the cups. This alternative therapy focuses on intensely pulling on the skin and tissue to stimulate energy flows along intended acupressure spots, instigating healing energy flows throughout the body and to the intended areas.
 
    Gua Sha: Gua Sha is a healing technique used in Asia. It involves palpation and cutaneous stimulation where the skin is pressured, in strokes, by a round-edged instrument; that results in the appearance of small red petechial called ‘sha’, which will fade in 2 to 3 days.

<strong>All of the above has been explained to me and I have no further questions at this time.</strong>
 I consent to treatment with acupuncture and Oriental medicine at BA Natural.
 I understand that there are no guarantees concerning treatment. I understand that there may be other treatment alternatives, including treatment that might be offered by a licensed physician.
 I understand that I am free to refuse or stop treatment at any time</div>
